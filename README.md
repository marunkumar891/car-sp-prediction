# car-Selling_Price-prediction
### This is an End-to-End application that takes relavant details of the car from users and predict it's selling price.

- The model is built to predict the car's selling price and understand how various factors would influence it.

- I've used this information to find an optimal set of parameters that would allow us to predict the Selling Price of the car. 

- Since this is regression problem, **Linear regression** Algorithm is used to predict the selling price of the car.

- The regression model I've implemented has a **R_2 score of 0.86**.

- This model is also deployed in **Heroku** using **Heroku_CLI** at [The Wheels](https://car-sp-predictions.herokuapp.com/)
